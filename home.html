In fact, there is a good chance you know someone who is struggling with it since nearly 20% of American adults face some form of mental illness in their lifetime. So why aren’t we talking about it?” </p>

                What is a Healthy Lifestyle? Its a way of living that LOWERS THE RISK of being seriously ill or dying
                early. Not all illness and disease is preventable; however a large proportion of deaths, particularly
                those from coronary heart disease and lung cancer, can be avoided.
                But I would like to think of a healthy lifestyle as more than just body. It is all inclusive. Mind, Body and Soul.
